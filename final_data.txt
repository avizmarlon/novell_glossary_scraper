WAN	wide area network. A network, not confined to a single location, that communicates over a long distance, such as across a city or around the world. A WAN is usually formed by connecting smaller local area networks (LANs).

WAN call destination	A remote call configuration for a WAN link. One call configuration equals one virtual circuit on one WAN link and contains the parameters needed by the WAN link driver to establish and maintain links to a given destination.

watchdog	Short for "watchdog packet."

watchdog packet	Packets used to make sure workstations are still connected to the NetWare server.. All settings are determined by the SET parameters.. Server parameters can be set so that if the server hasnt received a packet from a station in a certain time, a watchdog packet is sent to the station. If the station doesnt respond within a certain time, another watchdog packet is sent.. If the station still doesnt respond to a certain number of watchdog packets, the server assumes that the station is no longer connected and clears the stations connection.. The time period before the first watchdog packet, the time period between watchdog packets, and the number of watchdog packets are configurable using the SET utility.

Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning	WebDAV. A set of standard extensions for the HTTP protocol that enables users to edit and manage files collaboratively on a Web server. This new Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard basically transforms the Internet from Read-only to Read/Write. It is supported by most operating systems and applications from Microsoft, Oracle, and Adobe. WebDAV uses XML encoding to move, copy, delete, and create collections of items (groups of like objects, such as documents). WebDAV also supports getting and setting properties, such as document titles or author name. It is used for general Web document storage.

Web browser	A client application that connects to a Web server over a network or other communication link. It can also browse locally. Browsers send FTP, HTTP, or other types of requests to view HTML or other documents or to access services on the Web. The browser serves as a front end to the World Wide Web, for viewing documents on the Web.

Web server	A server application that publishes HTML and other types of documents on the World Wide Web. When a Web server receives an HTTP, FTP, or other type of request for a document from a Web browser, it responds by sending the document to the browser.

Win2NCS	Windows-to-Novell Connection Service. A collection of software programs that allow users to dial out from the network though a pool of modems connected to the server so they can access bulletin boards, host computers, or other resources, or to dial in and remotely control a dedicated network workstation using third-party communications applications.. Win2NCS allows users to "redirect" data to and from a Windows communication port. Instead of going through a modem connected to the workstations COM port, data is routed to a port controlled by the Novell速 Connection Service (NCS) on the Novell Internet Access Server (NIAS) 4.1 server. In this way Win2NCS gives a sharing capability to modems similar to the capability that print servers have given to printers. Instead of having a modem on each machine, users only need a modem pool on the server.. Previously called the NASI Redirector.

It contains the issuers name, the users identifying information, and the issuers digital signature, as well as other possible extensions in version 3 of the X.509 standard.

Xerox Network Systems	XNS. A protocol on which Novell IPX is based. One major difference between IPX and XNS is that they do not use the same ethernet encapsulation format. A second difference is that IPX uses Novells proprietary Service Advertisement Protocol (SAP).

XID	Exchange Identification. A specific type of link unit (commands and responses) used to carry node and link characteristics between adjacent nodes.. XIDs are exchanged between link stations before activation to negotiate acceptable characteristics. XIDs are also exchanged during activation to adjust for changes in these characteristics.

XNS	Xerox Network Systems. A protocol on which Novell速 IPX is based. One major difference between IPX and XNS is that they do not use the same ethernet encapsulation format. A second difference is that IPX uses Novells proprietary Service Advertisement Protocol (SAP).

XON/XOFF	A handshake protocol that prevents a sending system from transmitting data faster than a receiving system can accept it by using a Clear to Send signal.. For example, it can be used between a port and a printer to avoid troubleshooting the printer or cable pin configuration.

XTier	An authentication framework that resides on the middle-tier server. Xtier is utilized by several of Novell's Web-based applications to provide secure authentication to corporate servers across an Internet connection. Xtier works in conjunction with other software to provide services across the Web. For example, in NetStorage, users can map drives to files located on secure corporate servers through a Web browser. Xtier provides the authentication portion of the connection, and WebDAV is responsible for mapping the drive.. See also middle-tier server.
