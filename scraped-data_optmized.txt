Object rights and property rights are inherited and filtered separately; therefore, object and property rights can be blocked individually without affecting each other.
######
Inherited Rights Mask

A binary value that specifies a combination of rights in the NetWare file system. When a trustee has no assigned rights to a file or directory, the trustee inherits rights from a superior directory for which rights are assigned.

######
memory

The internal dynamic storage of a computer that can be addressed by the computers operating system, referred to frequently as RAM.

Memory accepts and holds binary data. To be effective, a computer must store the data that is operated on, as well as the program that directs the operations to be performed.

Types of memory include conventional, expanded, extended, upper, high, system, etc.
######
memory allocation

The process of reserving specific memory locations in RAM for processes, instructions, and data.

When a computer system is installed, the installer may allocate memory for items such as disk caches, RAM disks, extended memory, and expanded memory.

Operating systems and application programs allocate memory to meet their requirements, but they can use only that memory actually available to them.

Memory can be reallocated between resources to optimize performance. The proper memory allocation mix depends on the applications that are run.

A middle-tier server can support a variety of clients, such as Web browsers, Java applications, and hand-held devices. The clients handle the user interface and do not query databases or file systems directly; the middle-tier server handles the requests.

This fulfills a users individual network setup needs, such as mapping to a specific working directory or connecting to a printer. This login script executes last. When a user is created (User object), this login script automatically sets up mappings to the users home directory and to the PUBLIC directory on the server. Youll find it in a User object of your company such as an employee. For example, if you open the NEAT utility, click on a users name to select it, and click the Login Script tab for the user, the users personal login script will open.

If the station still doesnt respond to a certain number of watchdog packets, the server assumes that the station is no longer connected and clears the stations connection.

The time period before the first watchdog packet, the time period between watchdog packets, and the number of watchdog packets are configurable using the SET utility.

Win2NCS

Windows-to-Novell Connection Service

A collection of software programs that allow users to dial out from the network though a pool of modems connected to the server so they can access bulletin boards, host computers, or other resources, or to dial in and remotely control a dedicated network workstation using third-party communications applications.

Win2NCS allows users to "redirect" data to and from a Windows communication port. Instead of going through a modem connected to the workstations COM port, data is routed to a port controlled by the Novell® Connection Service (NCS) on the Novell Internet Access Server (NIAS) 4.1 server. In this way Win2NCS gives a sharing capability to modems similar to the capability that print servers have given to printers. Instead of having a modem on each machine, users only need a modem pool on the server.

Previously called the NASI Redirector.
