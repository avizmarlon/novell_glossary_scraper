certificate

In public-key cryptography, a digital document attesting to the binding of a public key to an owner (such as an individual or a Web server). A certificate verifies claims that a given public key does in fact belong to a given individual. It is used to prevent unauthorized users from using phony keys to impersonate legitimate users.

Certificates contain, at a minimum, a public key and a name. Normally they also contain the expiration date of the key, the name of the certifying authority that issued the certificate, and the serial number of the certificate. They can also contain the digital signature of the certificate issuer.

Also called "digital certificate," "digital ID," "digital passport," and "public key certificate."

context

The position or location of an object in the NDS tree. When an administrator adds an object (such as a server or user) to the network, that object is placed in a container in the NDS tree. The path of containers from the root of the tree to the new object constitutes the objects context. For example, if a User object were created in a container called SALES, which itself was located in a top-level container called ACME, the context of the User object would be SALES.ACME.

Designated Router

The router in a NetWare Link Services Protocol (NLSP) internetwork that represents its network. It is responsible for exchanges of link state information on behalf of all other NLSP routers in the same LAN. Its two main functions are to

Originate Link-State Advertisements (LSAs) on behalf of the network segment

Establish an adjacency relationship to all other routers on the network segment

NLSP elects the Designated Router by determining which router on the network has the highest priority number. A network administrator can configure the priority number value to determine which router is elected and which router remains the Designated Router.

directory

A collection of files and other subdirectories. Directories are information containers, like files. However, instead of text or other data, directories contain files and other directories. In addition, directories are hierarchically organized; that is, a directory has a parent directory "above" and may also have subdirectories "below." Similarly, each subdirectory can contain other files and also can have more subdirectories. Because they are hierarchically organized, directories provide a logical way to organize files.

Directory

A network database that provides look-up information for a single, logical NDS network. In larger networks, the database is usually distributed across multiple servers. The entries in the database provide access-control information for the individual users, servers, printers, and other objects in the network.

directory entry table

DET

A table on every network volume that records directory entries for each file on the volume. The table, stored in the servers memory, enables quick access to the location of every file.

Directory Map object

In the NDS tree, a leaf object that represents a path on a volume. It allows users to map a drive to a resource without knowing its physical location. If the path to the resource changes, only the Directory Map needs to be updated; users MAP commands stay the same.

directory path

The full specification that includes server name, volume name, and name of each directory leading to a file system directory. The position of a file within the file system is its directory path.

DS

A network service that provides information about an entity of interest. It is like an electronic phone book to help network clients find services. There are several designs, including the X.500 standard, the Domain Name System, and NDS.

NDS is a global, distributed, replicated database built into NetWare that maintains information about every resource on the network. It enables centralized management of networks of any size, and has a hierarchical, tree-like structure.

2. A logical group of network servers that provides extended network services, appearing to users as a single network server.

3. One of two memory segments (OS and OS_PROTECTED) in the NetWare OS that provides memory protection. Domains allow a developer or system administrator to isolate an NLM from the NetWare OS during development or testing. This feature is limited to NetWare 4.0 through 4.1.

4. A label of the DNS tree; each node on the DNS tree represents a domain. A domain is also known as a zone.

5. A group of page tables. A domains page tables are listed in the page directory table. Page tables map the noncontiguous pages into contiguous logical address spaces.

6. In Novell® GroupWise, physically, a directory structure on a server. The domain directory structure contains a group of processes, databases, and message-queue subdirectories. They are represented logically as GroupWise container objects in the NDS database. A domain has the following basic components: directory store, message transfer agent (MTA), administration agent (ADA), and input and output queues.

7. In GroupWise® 5, a grouping of one or more post offices. A domain serves two main purposes:

- It organizes post offices into a logical group for addressing and routing purposes within the GroupWise system.

- Through NDS, it serves as the main administration unit for the GroupWise system.

8. A high-level organizational grouping or naming hierarchy within the Internet. Domains commonly make up part of Internet addresses, and can include:

- arpa - initial Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) domains

- com - commercial or business groups

- edu - colleges and universities

- gov - government organizations

- int - international organizations

- mil - military

- org - miscellaneous groups

- net - network administrative hosts

- two-digit alphanumeric string - a variable indicating a country

Syntactically, an Internet domain name consists of a sequence of names separated by periods.

Exterior Gateway Protocol

EGP

A protocol that exchanges network access information between autonomous systems. EGP is part of the TCP/IP protocol suite.

Routers within each autonomous system are chosen to use EGP to talk to the outside world, usually over the Internet. These EGP routers are called exterior routers.

The exterior routers become EGP neighbors. The EGP neighbors exchange information about the networks that can be reached within the neighbors respective autonomous systems.

Only inherited rights can be filtered. Rights granted at the current level, either by explicit assignment or by security equivalence, cannot be blocked.

The Supervisor right can be blocked to an object but not to a file or directory.

Object rights and property rights are inherited and filtered separately; therefore, object and property rights can be blocked individually without affecting each other.

Inherited Rights Mask

A binary value that specifies a combination of rights in the NetWare file system. When a trustee has no assigned rights to a file or directory, the trustee inherits rights from a superior directory for which rights are assigned. The Inherited Rights Mask can be used to modify those inherited rights. If the Inherited Rights Mask is 0, the trustee inherits all rights from the superior directory. In NetWare 4 this term was rendered obsolete by the inherited rights filter.

internal net number

A unique hexadecimal number that is assigned to the NetWare server at installation and serves as a server identification number. It is stored in the autoexec.ncf file and should not be deleted.

IPX uses this number to advertise services and route IPX packets to the external IPX networks attached to the server. On IPX networks this number must also be different from the IPX external network number.

IP uses this number to provide passive IPX support called Compatibility Mode. This means that even though the NetWare server does not advertise or broadcast in this mode, the NetWare server can process and respond to incoming IPX requests.

interrupt

An asynchronous operating system condition that disrupts normal execution and transfers control to an interrupt handler. Interrupts can be issued by both software and hardware devices requiring service from the processor. When software issues an interrupt, it calls an interrupt service routine (ISR). When hardware issues an interrupt, it signals its interrupt request (IRQ) line.

Different tasks require different interrupt types, such as device I/O interrupts for LAN and disk drivers, hardware platform-specific interrupts that are local to a processor, interprocessor interrupts generated by one processor to affect another processor, and timer interrupts that provide timer services for the OS as well as preemption support.

key pair

An encyrption technology consisting of a public key (available to everyone) and a private key (owned by and available only to a specific individual or entity).

A key pair is used to encrypt or convert information into a format that is difficult or impossible to read. In a digital signature system, the key pair creates and validates the digital signature. In an encryption system, the key pair encrypts and decrypts the message body.

The public and private keys have the following relationships:

-Data encrypted with the public key can be decrypted with the private key only.

-Data signed with the private key can be verified with the public key only.

-Exposing a public key does not expose the corresponding private key.

key size

The size (in bits) of the public key. Generally, the larger the key size, the more resistant the private key is to cryptanalysis (subversion of cryptosystem).

load automatically

To load a program during a computer or an operating system startup process without any user intervention.

Generally, this is done by adding a command to the startup file, such as config.sys, startup.ncf, or autoexec.bat. Sometimes it is done simply by setting certain parameters in a program; for example, if a program that otherwise would load automatically required a password, setting the password would allow the program to load without user intervention.

Loadable Storage Subsystem

LSS

A layer in the NSS software architecture that exchanges information with the Media Access Layer (MAL) about storage devices and volumes. Information about the devices and volumes then flows up through the object engine and into the semantic agents. LSS provides the interface for non-NSS storage formats such as CD-ROMs.

Locality

L

One of the five types of container objects that can be created and added to the NDS tree. The other four are Country (C), Licensed Product (LP), Organization (O), and Organizational Unit (OU). Locality designates the location of this portion of the network. For example, if a Country object such as US exists, a Locality object, EAST, can be added for the East coast under US. The object is placed below the Country object, Organization object, or Organizational Unit object.

log file

One of the three types of files produced by each backup session. The other two are Data file and Error file. Log Files are placed in a directory on the host server and accessed through the SBACKUP "Main Menu" screen. The log files are labeled with the same description given the session. Both log and error files contain information such as the sessions date, time, and media identification, but the error file also contains a list of any errors that occurred during the backup session, such as files that were not backed up.

login restriction

A limitation on a user account that controls access to the network. Examples of login restrictions include password requirements, account limits, disk space limits, number of connections, and time restrictions. When a user violates login restrictions, NetWare disables the account and no one can log in using that username.

login script

A list of commands that are executed when a user logs in to the network. The commands are typically used to establish connections to network resources. A login script is a property of a container, Profile, Template, or User object. If a login script is defined for each of these objects (except the Template), when a user logs in, all associated login scripts will execute.

Note: The Template script establishes the Login Script property when a new User object is created. As soon as the administrator tailors the script for that particular User object, the Template script no longer executes.

LRU sitting time

A field in the Cache Utilization screen of MONITOR that displays the time elapsed since the oldest block in the Least Recently Used (LRU) list was referenced. The LRU list identifies the least recently used data blocks, that is, blocks that have been in cache the longest time without being accessed. A high LRU sitting time indicates that the server has sufficient memory to handle disk requests or that requests are fairly static.

memory

The internal dynamic storage of a computer that can be addressed by the computers operating system, referred to frequently as RAM.

Memory accepts and holds binary data. To be effective, a computer must store the data that is operated on, as well as the program that directs the operations to be performed.

Types of memory include conventional, expanded, extended, upper, high, system, etc.

memory allocation

The process of reserving specific memory locations in RAM for processes, instructions, and data.

When a computer system is installed, the installer may allocate memory for items such as disk caches, RAM disks, extended memory, and expanded memory.

Operating systems and application programs allocate memory to meet their requirements, but they can use only that memory actually available to them.

Memory can be reallocated between resources to optimize performance. The proper memory allocation mix depends on the applications that are run.

message digest

A compressed or condensed form of a document, or an abstract from a document, that functions as a "digital fingerprint" of the larger document. A message digest is used to create a digital signature that is unique to a particular document.

A message digest can be made public without revealing the contents of the document from which it is derived. This is important in digital time-stamping, where, using hash functions, one can get a document time-stamped without revealing its contents to the time-stamping service.

message pacing

A technique by which a receiving component controls the rate of transmission of a sending component to prevent overrun or congestion. Message pacing sets the maximum number of request units (RUs) that the local LU can receive without sending a pacing response on sessions for the specified mode name. The maximum number of RUs is the pacing window. The range of values is 0 through 63.

middle-tier server

Resides between the client and the file system or database. A middle-tier server receives and processes requests from clients. This often eliminates the need for client programs to deal with the complexity of databases and other complex back-end systems. A middle-tier server can support a variety of clients, such as Web browsers, Java applications, and hand-held devices. The clients handle the user interface and do not query databases or file systems directly; the middle-tier server handles the requests.

See also XTier.

mirrored server engine

MSEngine

The part of the SFT III operating system that handles nonphysical processes, such as the NetWare file system, queue management, and NDS.

SFT III is split into two parts: the IOEngine (Input/Output Engine) and the MSEngine. The primary server and the secondary server each have a separate IOEngine, but they share the same MSEngine. The file system, receive buffers, and queue management system all reside in the MSEngine.

Applications and NLM programs that do not address hardware directly can be mirrored by loading them in the MSEngine. If one server fails, applications and NLM programs in the MSEngine continue to run. The MSEngine keeps track of active network processes; it provides uninterrupted network service when the primary server fails and the secondary server takes over.

name server

A DNS entry for a Post Office Agent (POA). The name server identifies the IP address of one of the POAs in the GroupWise system. This enables the GroupWise client to connect through TCP/IP to the name server POA without the user needing to know the IP address of the POA. Once the GroupWise client is connected, the name server POA then tells the GroupWise client the IP address of the POA servicing the users post office. The GroupWise client then logs in to that POA.

There can be a primary name server and a backup name server. The DNS host name for the primary name server must be NGWNAMESERVER. The DNS host name for the backup name server must be NGWNAMESERVER2.

NDS management request

A request that controls the physical distribution of the NDS database. Through these requests, network administrators can create new NDS partitions and manage their replicas. The following requests are supported:

Add replica

Delete replica

List replicas

Change replica type

Send updates to other replicas

Receive updates from other replicas

Create a new partition

Merge partition

Abort partition operation

NDS replica

A copy of an NDS partition.

For the NDS database to be distributed across a network, it must be stored on many servers. Rather than storing a copy of the whole NDS database on each server, NDS replicas of each partition are stored on many servers throughout the network. Administrators can create an unlimited number of NDS replicas for each partition and store them on any server.

NDS replicas serve two purposes; they eliminate single points of failure, and they provide faster access to information for users across WAN links.

Types of NDS replicas include master replicas, read/write replicas, read-only replicas, and subordinate reference replicas.

To maintain fault tolerance, the replicas of a partition are periodically (and automatically) updated, or synchronized.

NetWare Connect Services Selector

NWCSS

The NLM that automatically routes incoming calls to the appropriate service as part of remote access supporting diverse client types. The Services Selector interfaces with AIO and monitors ports on behalf of the registered services. The Services Selector determines the appropriate destination of the incoming data, then relinquishes port control to the appropriate service. In a remote dial-in connection, the Services Selector queries the caller for the available session (that is, the network workstation) to which the caller wants to connect.

node number

A number that uniquely identifies a network board, also known as station address, physical node address, and node address.

Every node must have at least one network board, by which the node is connected to the network. Each network board must have a unique node number to distinguish it from all other network boards on that network.

Node numbers are assigned in several ways, depending on the network board type. For example, Ethernet and token ring boards are factory-set (with no two Ethernet boards having the same number), while ARCnet board numbers are set with jumpers or switches. Node addresses are dynamically assigned each time the node is started.

null key

A key field that can be a user-defined character. Btrieve allows two types of null keys: any-segment (called a manual key in earlier versions of Btrieve) and all-segment (simply called a null key in earlier Btrieve versions).

An any-segment null key does not include a particular record in the index if the value of any key segment of that record matches the null value.

An all-segment null key only excludes a particular record from the index if the value of all key segment of that record matches the null value.

NWCSS

NetWare Connect Services Selector

The NLM that automatically routes incoming calls to the appropriate service as part of remote access supporting diverse client types. The Services Selector interfaces with AIO and monitors ports on behalf of the registered services. The Services Selector determines the appropriate destination of the incoming data, then relinquishes port control to the appropriate service. In a remote dial-in connection, the Services Selector queries the caller for the available session (that is, the network workstation) to which the caller wants to connect.

object

In the Common Desktop Environment (CDE),

1. Any related group of objects.

2. In Application Builder, any of the defined elements---windows, panes, or controls---used in building a user interface. Application Builder objects are represented by icons on the object palettes of the primary window; they become interface objects once they are dragged and dropped. An Application Builder object is composed of one or more widgets.

3. In the OSF/Motif Style Guide, an element that visually represents something that has behavior and contents not revealed solely by the visual representation. Objects are often represented as icons, but could be represented in other ways as well; for example, as list items.

object

Short for "abstract object."

In SNMP, one integral set of information.

An object can be single (a single-instance object), or can occur several times with different data representing different real-world items (a multiple-instance object). For example, a table of system management contacts is a multiple-instance object. Each contact is an instance of the table.

object

An entity defined in the NDS® database. Each object consists of properties and the values for the properties. There are three general categories of NDS objects: container objects, leaf objects, and the [Root] object.

Container objects generally represent abstract entities, including the Organization and Organizational Unit objects. Leaf objects generally contain information about physical network entities such as users and devices. A [Root] object is created during installation as the parent directory for all other objects.

Object Request Broker

ORB

A component in the CORBA programming model that acts as the middleware between clients and servers. In the CORBA object-based computing model, a client can request a service without knowing anything about what servers are attached to the network. The various ORBs receive the requests, forward them to the appropriate servers, and then hand the results back to the client.

Novell has its own ORB.

offline UPS

offline uninterruptible power source

A backup power unit that supplies uninterrupted power if a commercial power outage occurs. Offline UPS monitors the power line. When power drops, the UPS is activated. The drawback to this method is the slight lag before the offline UPS becomes active. However, most offline UPS systems are fast enough to offset this lag.

on-demand SVC

on-demand switched virtual circuit

A virtual circuit that is closed after data has been transmitted over the established switched virtual circuit (SVC). The circuit remains closed until more data is queued for sending, at which point connection is reestablished.

online help

1. An electronic documentation file formatted according to the requirements of the destination operating system. Help files generally contain short instructions about how to perform certain features. They generally have fewer graphics than printed or electronic books of the same material. Help files reformat as needed to the screen window dimensions, and make heavy use of hypertext linking, pop-up boxes, and so forth. Help files are context-sensitive, which means that you can jump to a specific topic within the help file directly from the applications dialog and menu interface, etc.

2. A feature that provides a convenient means of accessing information about NetWare functions and concepts from any workstation on the network.

Open Shortest Path First protocol

OSPF protocol

A hierarchical Interior Gateway Protocol routing algorithm that relies on OSPF routers having constructed a complete topology of the network from link states. For each destination, the router examines its link state database and selects the shortest path as the route to that destination. OSPF then allows the routers to derive such information as least-cost routing, equal-cost routing, and load balancing.

poison pill

polled mode

In NetWare queue-base printing, the default transmission mode for printers. In this mode, the printer port driver (NPRINTER) periodically checks, or polls, its data port to determine whether its ready to accept data transmission. The ports status is indicated by an electronic signal called a flag. Checks are made at each CPU timer tick (18 per second).

port

The point of contact between two hardware devices or two software elements.

A hardware port can be the physical connection point between a printer cable and the computer.

A software port, represented by a memory address, can be the logical contact point between a LAN driver and the protocol bound to it, or the point of access to a service on a TCP/IP host computer.

preemption

An operating system scheduling technique that allows the operating system to take control of the processor at any instant, regardless of the state of the currently running application. Preemption guarantees better response to the user and higher data throughput. Most operating systems are not preemptive multitasking, meaning that task-switching occurs asynchronously and only when an executing task relinquishes control of the processor.

primary logical unit

PLU

The logical unit (LU) that sends the BIND command to activate a session with its partner LU, which means it contains the primary half-session for a particular LU-LU session.

A logical unit can contain secondary and primary half-sessions for different active LU-LU sessions.

primary server

The SFT III NetWare server that has been operating longer than its partner and is currently servicing workstations. The primary server handles workstation requests for network services. It also handles routing packets from routers on the internetwork.

If the primary server fails, the secondary server becomes the new primary server.

print device

1. A printer, plotter, or other peripheral that prints from the network.

2. A defined set of printer functions and modes that are supported for the Printer objects in a container. Print devices can be saved as print device files (.pdf files).

print device definition

A set of functions and modes found in a file (with a .pdf extension) that corresponds to a printer, plotter, or other peripheral.

Print device definitions contain the necessary control sequences for setting or resetting the printer, and for controlling bold, emphasis, italics, print size, font selection, colors, and other features, depending on the printer.

A print device definition does not necessarily represent the full functionality of the printer. A print device definition can be modified to change the functions the machine can perform.

Print Device Subsystem

PDS

An NDPS server component used by the Novell printer gateway, first to retrieve printer-specific information by reading Page Description Language (PDL), and second, to store it in a database. The PDS is used when creating a Printer Agent to represent a printer that either is not connected directly to the network (a local or remote printer), or is directly connected to the network but either its manufacturer does not provide a proprietary NDPS gateway or it is running in PSERVER mode.

Printer Agent

A logical entity that represents an NDPS printer, combining the functions previously performed by a printer, print queue, print server, and spooler into one intelligent and simplified entity. Before a printer can be incorporated into an NDPS printing environment, it must be represented by a Printer Agent.

Printer Communications Protocol

PCP

An SPX-based communications protocol used by printer drivers (nprinter.nlm and nprinter.exe) to communicate with print servers (pserver.nlm).

printer definition file

.pdf

A file, containing a print device definition, that controls a printer, plotter, or other peripheral.

Print device definitions contain the necessary control sequences for setting or resetting the printer, and for controlling bold, emphasis, italics, print size, font selection, colors, and other features, depending on the printer.

A print device definition does not necessarily represent the full functionality of the printer. A print device definition can be modified to change the functions the machine can perform.

printer form

A defined set of paper dimensions that can be specified for a print job. When a print job requests a form not in the printer, the print server must wait to service the job until the user mounts the form.

printer function

An action that the printer can perform, such as bold text or proportional spacing. The printer performs the function when it receives control sequences in the print job.

printer language

A protocol or type of printing that a printer can receive, for example: PCL, PCL 5, or PostScript.

printer mode

A sequence of print functions (also called printer commands, control sequences, or escape sequences) that determines the appearance of the printed file. For example, a user might define a printer mode called Title that includes functions for bold, double wide, and letter-quality printing.

Printer object

In the NDS tree, a leaf object that represents a physical print device in the network, such as a printer or plotter. Each network printer requires a NetWare printer driver, such as nprinter.exe or nprinter.nlm, to service network print jobs.

print header

In NetWare queue-based printing, an administrator-set number of bytes preceding the print job file. The header consists of the control codes for the modes defined in PRINTDEF. The control codes are transported to the queue in two parts of the print job file, the print header and the print tail. This is especially critical for PostScript printing.

print job

In NetWare queue-based printing, a file stored in a print queue directory. As soon as a print server sends a print job to the printer, the print job is deleted from the queue directory.

print job configuration

A predefined set of options that a user can apply to a print job. It frees the user from having to specify each option setting when using print utilities such as NPRINT and CAPTURE. The characteristics can include the following:

- Printer to be used

- Print queue to be used

- Number of copies to print

- Use of a banner page

- Printer form

- Print device mode

Users can create print job configurations using NetWare Administrator or PRINTCON.

pseudo hop count

The number of hops that the primary server adds to the true hop count (the number of internal and external bridges and routers between a client and the server) when it advertises the route to the SFT III MSEngine.

If SFT III servers reside on different network segments, the hop count for one server is higher than the other. To ensure that packets are rerouted properly to the surviving server in the event one server fails, the primary server advertises an artificially high hop count (the true hop count plus a pseudo hop count).

reference time server

A server that provides the time to which all other time servers and workstations on an eDirectory network synchronize.

Reference time servers can be synchronized with an external time source, such as an atomic clock. Reference time servers vote with other primary or reference time servers to determine what the common network time should be. However, reference time servers don't adjust their internal clocks; instead, the primary servers internal clocks are adjusted to synchronize with the reference time server.

Routing Information Protocol

A distance vector internal gateway protocol for TCP/IP and IPX networks. A TCP/IP Routing Information Protocol (RIP) router periodically broadcasts a routing update message that contains an entry for each network it can reach and the cost (distance) to that network.

RIP II

An enhancement to the TCP/IP Routing Information Protocol (RIP) that includes the subnetwork mask in its routes.

The lack of subnetwork mask information limits RIP to advertising only network routes, or requires RIP routers to make assumptions about the subnetwork mask. When RIP is used in subnetworks, all subnetworks are usually required to use the same subnetwork mask.

RIP II can be used in network topologies requiring variable length subnetwork masks, and it is able to support subnetwork 0. RIP II can also authenticate routing message exchanges.

Not all RIP routers support RIP II.

routing information filter

A filter that restricts the exchange of routing information between routers. To increase security, these filters limit the visibility of selected networks and reduce the network bandwidth consumed by the periodic exchange of routing information.

Routing Information Protocol

RIP

A distance vector protocol that provides a measure of distance, or hops, from a transmitting system to a receiving system. RIP allows NetWare routers to create and maintain a database (or router table) of current internetwork routing information.

routing protocol

A protocol that uses a specific routing algorithm. Examples of routing protocols include Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Network Link Services Protocol (NLSP), Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP), and AppleTalk Update-based Routing Protocol (AURP).

routing table

A database in a router that keeps track of routes (and in some cases, metrics associated with those routes) to local and remote network destinations. The routing table enables a router to forward datagrams from a source socket to a destination socket.

In IP, routing tables are maintained on all hosts.

Routing Table Maintenance Protocol

RTMP

A distance vector protocol that updates tables every 10 seconds; used by routers to exchange information.

RTMP is the routing protocol used by AppleTalk. It is very similar to RIP.

routing update

A message sent from a router to indicate that a network can be reached. The message includes associated cost information. A routing update is typically sent at regular intervals as well as after a change in network topology.

scatter gather

A feature of many disk drivers that improves the performance of disk reads and writes by combining many small I/O requests into one.

If data is to be written to sequential locations on disk, the driver "gathers" the data from different locations in RAM and combines the data into one write.

If data is to be read from sequential locations on disk, the driver executes one read and then "scatters" the data to different locations in RAM.

Sequenced Packet Exchange

SPX

A NetWare DOS Requester module that enhances the IPX protocol by supervising data sent out across the network.

SPX verifies and acknowledges successful packet delivery to any network destination by requesting a verification from the destination that the data was received.

The SPX verification must include a value that matches the value calculated from the data before transmission. By comparing these values, SPX ensures not only that the data packet arrived at the destination, but that it arrived intact.

SFT

System Fault Tolerance

A means of protecting data by providing procedures that allow a network server to automatically recover from hardware failures. SFT protects data by providing data duplication on multiple storage devices; if one storage device fails, the data is available from another device.

There are three levels of SFT: Hot Fix, disk mirroring or duplexing, and server mirroring. Each level of redundancy (duplication) decreases the possibility of data loss.

sparse file

A file with at least one empty block. (NetWare wont write any block that is completely empty.) Databases often create sparse files.

For example, suppose the disk allocation block size for volume Vol1 is 4 KB. Also suppose that a database opens a new file, seeks out the 1,048,576th byte, writes five bytes, and closes the file. An inefficient operating system would save the entire file to disk.The file would be comprised of 256 zero-filled disk allocation blocks (the first 1 MB) and one more disk allocation block with five bytes of data and 4,091 zeros. This method would waste 1 MB of disk space. However, NetWare writes only the last block to disk, saving time and disk space.

S

A NetWare file system right that grants all rights to a directory or file. Also, an NDS object right that grants all rights to an object (including all its properties). Also, an NDS property right that grants all rights to a specific property.

The Supervisor right can be blocked by an inherited rights filter (IRF) on an object or property, but it cannot be blocked by an IRF on a directory or file.

There is no automatic Supervisor user in NetWare versions after NetWare 3.

SVC

switched virtual circuit

A type of virtual circuit that is established dynamically with call setup and call clearing procedures. A permanent SVC is left in a connected state until the user or application disconnects it. An on-demand SVC is disconnected after data has been transmitted over the established SVC. The circuit remains disconnected until more data is queued for sending, at which point the connection is reestablished.

time slicing

A thread pre-emption technique which allocates some amount of the resources time to each of the multiple threads (applications or tasks) requesting the resource.

The scheduler allows the current thread to run on a given processor until either the thread blocks or a time slice (a predetermined length of time) expires. At that time, the scheduler stops execution of the running thread and allows another eligible thread to run...until either it blocks or the time slice expires, and so on.

trap

To test for a particular condition in a running program; for example, to "trap an interrupt" means to wait for a particular interrupt to occur and then execute a corresponding routine. An error trap tests for an error condition and provides a recovery routine. A debugging trap waits for the execution of a particular instruction in order to stop the program and analyze the status of the system at that moment.

trap

1. An unsolicited message sent by a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agent to a network management system that indicates the occurance of a significant event. The SNMP manager that receives a trap can poll for additional information.

2. An SNMP protocol data unit (PDU) that indicates an exceptional condition.

3. A type of command within the SNMP protocol. A special command the agent uses to inform the (SNMP) manager of a special event. By default, the traps are sent to a local system.

4. A type of message that can be transmitted for any reason.

5. An SNMP trap is a message sent by an agent to a manager when certain events are detected.

tree

Short for "NDS tree."

A hierarchical structure of objects in the NDS database. The NDS tree includes container objects that are used to organize the network. The structure of the NDS tree can be based on a logical organization of objects, and not necessarily on their physical location.

uniform resource locator

URL

A generalization of the file naming concepts already in common use on the Internet. A URL extends the filename and pathname used to refer to files on a computer by adding an Internet address and protocol component. A URL specifies the computer and access method (protocol) in addition to the filename and thus can be used to refer to files anywhere on a network.

While URLs are used in various forms by different systems, they are most closely associated with the World Wide Web.

URL

uniform resource locator

A generalization of the file naming concepts already in common use on the Internet. A URL extends the filename and pathname used to refer to files on a computer by adding an Internet address and protocol component. A URL specifies the computer and access method (protocol) in addition to the filename and thus can be used to refer to files anywhere on a network.

While URLs are used in various forms by different systems, they are most closely associated with the World Wide Web.

User

1. Short for "User object."

2. A login script type that sets the environment for a single user. It is a property of the User object. This fulfills a users individual network setup needs, such as mapping to a specific working directory or connecting to a printer. This login script executes last. When a user is created (User object), this login script automatically sets up mappings to the users home directory and to the PUBLIC directory on the server. Youll find it in a User object of your company such as an employee. For example, if you open the NEAT utility, click on a users name to select it, and click the Login Script tab for the user, the users personal login script will open.

User Access Provisioning

NterpriseTM Branch OfficeTM appliance solution that automatically provides user access to servers for all users in the branch---including local and visiting employees and guests. User Access Provisioning uses the LDAP protocol to provide local access at the branch office. If a User object resides in the corporate tree, users automatically gain access to the branch office appliance when they log in using their eDirectoryTM usernames and passwords. All rights and group assignments are also transferred to the local appliance.

virtual circuit

A type of circuit that provides a connection-oriented service similar to that of circuit switching, but with the following exceptions:

- It is limited to a connection between two end points.

- It has the advantage of economical statistical multiplexing for establishing a logical path through the network.

This logical path can be provided either on a permanent basis by a permanent virtual circuit (PVC), which is equivalent to a leased circuit, or on a request basis by an switched virtual circuit (SVC). Once the logical path is established, the packets are transferred between connected ends, as desired.

watchdog packet

Packets used to make sure workstations are still connected to the NetWare server.

All settings are determined by the SET parameters.

Server parameters can be set so that if the server hasnt received a packet from a station in a certain time, a watchdog packet is sent to the station. If the station doesnt respond within a certain time, another watchdog packet is sent.

If the station still doesnt respond to a certain number of watchdog packets, the server assumes that the station is no longer connected and clears the stations connection.

The time period before the first watchdog packet, the time period between watchdog packets, and the number of watchdog packets are configurable using the SET utility.

Win2NCS

Windows-to-Novell Connection Service

A collection of software programs that allow users to dial out from the network though a pool of modems connected to the server so they can access bulletin boards, host computers, or other resources, or to dial in and remotely control a dedicated network workstation using third-party communications applications.

Win2NCS allows users to "redirect" data to and from a Windows communication port. Instead of going through a modem connected to the workstations COM port, data is routed to a port controlled by the Novell® Connection Service (NCS) on the Novell Internet Access Server (NIAS) 4.1 server. In this way Win2NCS gives a sharing capability to modems similar to the capability that print servers have given to printers. Instead of having a modem on each machine, users only need a modem pool on the server.

Previously called the NASI Redirector.
